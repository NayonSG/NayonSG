Oh.. wait... Wrong quote.

Hi, my name is Nayon Silva Gomes, I'm 32 years old and I live in Brazil, currently in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais.
I've recently started learning about codding and deving, and I'm looking for a chance to work in this area.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, JS and React
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/His
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've always wanted to work with programing and dev, but all the math involved led me astray from the dev path. But now I'm back for good!
